# _Capstone Proposal_

## _Flora: A Botanical Companion_

### Project Purpose: 

As an avid plant collector and compulsive organizer, I’ve been trying to find an app or website that is the perfect plant journal/plant tracker. However, they all keep coming up short - so I’m hoping to build the perfect one (or at least what will eventually be the perfect one!) In phase one (MVP), the project will be a relatively simple database that allows a user to log in, create plant entries, and update or delete entries as needed (with some sort of log for watering/fertilizing schedules, plants notes, etc.) 

### MVP features:
* Create a plant database with full CRUD
* Responsive UI 
* Simple custom designs/illustrations
* Project Deployed 

### Tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

* React 
* Firebase / Firestore
* Illustrator / Photoshop
* Adobe XD
* Vercel or Firebase (for deployment)

### If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

* Add a parallax scroll splash page
* Integrate a calendar component to go with the the log - with alerts or reminders
* Add a plant data API
* Link a second API to fetch historical weather info and make plant care suggestions based on its results 
* Build an app version in React Native (this may be overly ambitious and is definitely a stretch goal!) 
* Experiment with Twitter API - allow a user to post plant milestones to twitter? 
* Add a shop to site where users can purchase supplies
  * And/or set up payment processing for pro plan 

### What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
* OpenWeather API (or another weather API)
* React Native  
* E-Commerce API
* Stripe Payment processing
